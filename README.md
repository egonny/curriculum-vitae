# curriculum-vitae
This is a digital version of my CV. The unformatted version can be found at [resume.md](./resume.md) and a formatted PDF can be downloaded from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/egonny/curriculum-vitae/releases/latest).

The Markdown file is turned into an HTML page using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), and this HTML page is turned into a PDF using [Athena](https://github.com/arachnys/athenapdf).
